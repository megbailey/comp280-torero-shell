The following requirements were not met:
- Correctly run foreground commands using the fork and execvp system calls.
- Have no functions whose body is greater than 25 lines of code (excluding
  comments and blank lines).
- Have well commented source code.

Grading Notes:
- All processes are background processes (nothing runs in the foreground)
- All other basic and advanced features work correctly.
- Your execute function is too long: the !num and cd cases should have their
  work done in separate functions.
- Missing header comments for history_queue functions.
